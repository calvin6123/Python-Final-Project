# Python Final Project

Year: Junior


Project title: Python Recorder and Looper

Github url: https://github.com/calvin6123/Python-Final-Project.git

Description: This program lets you record audio using python and lets you save it as a wav file. There is also a function allowing you to loop the audio for as many times as you'd like.  There are built in commands that allow for easy use, and you can also record multiple files.

Adversity: Originally my project was to add sound effects to existing audio files but after doing research and trying it out, it was too difficult for me. I learned that audio files are actually fairly complex to work with and you have to understand a lot about its properties such as sample rate, bit depth, and channels. Rather than giving up on the idea, I decided to create a program where it lets the user record audio and loop it a certain amount of time.  This was much more achievable and less complex than my original idea.  I still had to do a fair bit of research about working with audio files and had to install a lot of extensions such as playsound, sounddevice and scipy.  In the end, I think it worked out. 

The main sources I used for this project was the youtube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT5w-HNcr5A and the link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/260738/play-audio-with-python.
